The following questionaire is designed to assess the way you obtain and retain information (in theory and in practice).
Creativity will be welcome in the answers.

The application can be submitted by providing the answers
to [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKhcWN3VVSb-sYk0CPeXj0DDDaNIYn4Sz_fiWwKfpqWGUWnw/viewform).

### Non-technical 
Q. Tell us about a time when you learned something on your own. (300 words max.)

It might help you to think about the following while answering:  
- How did you find the resources?  
- What were the challenges?   
- What would have made it easier?   

*As long as your answer shows your approach to learning, do not fret about answering each sub-question*

Q. Tell us how you retain information that you have learned. (300 words max.)

The mentors agree that we tend to forget what we have learned in the past. 
Going into the program, we would like to know how you would keep track
of things you have learned and things would like to explore further.

You may also choose to send us a picture/screenshot of your notes 
on a particular topic you have learned (about computers or otherwise) 
or send links to your blog/vlog.

*Do not fret about the form of submission as long as it shows the way you track 
your own knowledge-base.
(example: a picture of a page from your notebook does not have a disadvantage 
over a blog submission for another applicant)*

### Technical
Capture the Flag (CTF) is a competition that puts together a set of security puzzles
that you can solve to get points. 
Here's an excellent [introduction to CTF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A) 
by LiveOverflow. You do not need to know everything in the video, just a sense of 
what a CTF is.

Headover to [CTFTIME.org](https://ctftime.org/). The site hosts information about CTFs
happening around the world, the challenges designed for those CTFs and the solutions
after the CTF is over.

Pick any challenge (one) from [CTFTIME.org](https://ctftime.org/). Readup on the challenge
and its solution (also called a write-up).

Q. In your own words, summarize the challenge and its solution.

It might help to think about the following while answering:
- Name/Category/Link of the challenge
- What did the authors of the challenge wanted participants to learn/notice
- What did you learn in the process
- What are ideas you are still unclear about in the challenge

*Do not fret about the sophistication of the challenge you pick or not knowing
everything in the solution. Just walk us through your thought-process/understanding*

Nmap is a tool commonly used to map a network and find vulnerable hosts.
An output from nmap looks like the following:

Q. Write a program that takes the above format and prints
out all the port numbers separated by a comma.

*Do not fret if you do not know what port numbers are. Just
a program that looks at the input as above and prints out
the port numbers.*

Q. Tell us about something you have always wanted to learn but 
haven't figured out yet. We will talk about it during the
interview and see if we can get you resources to figure it out.
