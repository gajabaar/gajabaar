## An Advice
Most of our applicants have found a prior conversation about our program
helpful in both writing their application as well as preparing for the interview.
On our end, we also find that the applications tend to be more polished and
the interviews tend to be more meaningful for candidates 
who have attended an info session on our program.
So, we strongly ENCOURAGE you to attend one of the info sessions below:
- March 24, 2023 at 7PM NPT 
- April 07, 2023 at 7PM NPT

## Application Submission Workflow
First of all, sign up for discord and join gajabaar server
(invite code: aY6PEUA). You will need your discord username/handle
in the application.

1. Head over to the 
[publicly available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1B2OV1qczRLdAkB5NoOhSNdzpTbvx9zbkInYFE9icg/edit?usp=sharing) 
read-only google-doc application.
2. Make a personal copy of the document to your account. (File > Make a Copy)
3. Edit the document to fill in your answers. We compiled 
[a sample complete application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D1m_fpLILB8AEK33WCl_cy635-T1mumWuUD-eeXKQvE/edit?usp=sharing) 
from applications we 
received for our previous application cycles, if you might find that helpful.
4. Export a pdf of your copy of the document. (File > Download > PDF Document (.pdf))
5. Email the pdf to [hello@gajabaar.io](mailto:hello@gajabaar.io) with subject "Gajabaar 2023 Summer Application". We recommend adding
a small note to avoid spam filters.

Once we receive your email, 
we will add you to a discord channel over the next few days.
The channel will also provide instructions on 
scheduling an interview and the subsequent results.
