## An Advice
Most of our applicants have found a prior conversation about our program
helpful in both writing their application as well as preparing for the interview.
On our end, we also find that the applications tend to be more polished and
the interviews tend to be more meaningful for candidates 
who have attended an info session on our program.
So, we strongly ENCOURAGE you to attend one of the info sessions below:

- May 7th, 2022 7PM NPT. [Click to Register](https://forms.gle/MqLSsCAaC5hygDbq7)

read-only google-doc application.
2. Make a personal copy of the document to your account. (File > Make a Copy)
