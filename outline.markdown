This year we are taking a more heads-on approach to cybersecurity.
We will focus on a single platform 
[Proving Grounds](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/individual/)
and tackle machines from there. Each week, one of the mentors will root/hack
one machine in real time during a lecture session. 
Afterwards, one to two machines of related concepts and comparable difficulty
will be picked as practice machines for the week.
Mentors will be available for office hours to help with the machines.

In the following weeks, we will update this page with the names of 
machines we intend to assign for lecture and practice.

<p class="message">
The certificate of completion will depend on mentees finishing
all assigned practice machines and submitting a report for them.
