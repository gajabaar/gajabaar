If you are interested to view out past syllabuses, 
consult:
- [2020 Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020-overview)
- [2021 Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021-overview)
- [2022 Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022-overview)

We are not quite sure on our outline for this year.
In each of the past years, we have taken a different
approach on what the content/syllabus is. We will 
send out an outline after interviews with the candidates
(their interest is important to us) and before the
results are sent out so the candidates can make 
informed decisions about if they want to sign up
for the program.
