<p class="message">
We are now accepting application for the 2021 cycle.
</p>

__Q. Could you tell me more?__   
Yes. We are a [group of people]({{ site.baseurl }}/mentors/) 
who wanted to provide you resources to build a skillset (and possibly a career) 
in cybersecurity. Our vision is a program where mentors listen to you about
your interests, ask you about your goals then design a path from where you 
are to where you want to get in cybersecurity. And if you are new to the whole
field, we will take you through an [introductory curriculum here]({{site.baseurl}}/outline).

__Q. What's a gajabaar though?__   
In traditional Nepali houses, a horizontal wooden bar secures the door from the inside. 
It's called a gajabaar.


__Q. Do I need prior exposure to cybersecurity?__  
No. You may find prior programming experience helpful. 
However, you will certainly need a computer and a stable internet connection. 
If you don't have one, we might still be able to work out a temporary solution for you.

__Q. When will the program run?__   
June to August, 2021. 
*This schedule is flexible to work around your more urgent commitments (like exams) with prior notice.*

__Q. Do I need to pay to be in the program?__   
No. In the past, we have also covered costs on behalf of the participants, 
including subscriptions to [Pentesterlab](https://pentesterlab.com),
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), and [National Cyber League](https://nationalcyberleague.org).

__Q. How much time will I commit?__   
We anticipate 10-20 hrs per week.
Workload will be adjusted as per feedback from the participant group.

__Q. Is it remote or on-site?__  
It's remote until the pandemic is under control.

__Q. Where do I apply?__   
Application guidelines are available on [How to Apply]({{site.baseurl}}/apply) page.

__Q. When is the application deadline?__   
April 1, 2021 

__Q. What happens when I submit my application?__   
We will get in touch to confirm receipt of your application. An interview will be scheduled
for after the application deadline. Please be sure to check your spam in the days following 
your application submission which is where our response lands sometimes.

__Q. In the meantime, how can I get in touch?__   
We are most responsive on our discord channel (invite code: aY6PEUA). It might take a day or two to get approved.

You can also reach us via email on [hello@gajabaar.io](mailto:hello@gajabaar.io). We usually respond within
a few days. The response sometimes lands on spam folder.
