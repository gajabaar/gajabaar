__Q. Could you tell me more?__   
Yes. We are a [group of people]({{ site.baseurl }}/mentors/) 
who wanted to provide you resources to build a skillset (and possibly a career) 
in cybersecurity. Our vision is a program where mentors listen to you about
your interests, ask you about your goals then design a path from where you 
are to where you want to get in cybersecurity. And if you are new to the whole
field, we will take you through an [introductory curriculum here]({{site.baseurl}}/outline).

__Q. What's a gajabaar though?__   
In traditional Nepali houses, a horizontal wooden bar secures the door from the inside. It's called a gajabaar.


__Q. Do I need prior exposure to cybersecurity?__  
No. You may find prior programming experience helpful though. However, you will certainly need a computer and a stable internet connection. If you don't have one, we might still be able to work out a temporary solution for you.

__Q. When will the program run?__   
June to August, 2020. *This schedule is flexible to work around your more urgent commitments (like exams) with prior notice.*

__Q. Is it a paid program?__   
Yes. We've allocated NRS 30,000 per participant.

__Q. How much time will I commit?__   
We anticipate 10-20 hrs per week.

__Q. Is it remote or on-site?__  
Both. You will spend time at companies as well as have remote sessions.

__Q. Where do I apply?__   
The application is available [via Qualtrics](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Vd60AaSoHyXxad). 
You can have a peek at the application questions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/apply).

__Q. When is the application deadline?__   
May 1, 2020  

__Q. What happens when I submit my application?__   
Within a week, we will get in touch to schedule an interview.
