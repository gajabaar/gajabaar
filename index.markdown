__Q. What's a gajabaar?__   
In traditional Nepali houses, a horizontal wooden bar secures the door from the inside. It's called a gajabaar.

__Q. So what's gajabaar, the program?__  
You meet the mentors. They will be your resources to build a skillset in cybersecurity.

__Q. Build a skillset in cybersecurity?__  
This will be different from individual to individual---at the beginning, we will have a conversation
about your current skill level and the skill level you would like to get at. Then we will 
come up with a plan to acheive that goal. 

For the ones new to cybsersecurity, a starter curriculum can be found under  
[Program Outline]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/).

__Q. Will I get PAID?__  
Yes - all expenses covered (tools/labs/books). We've allocated $300/mentee.

__Q. Do I need prior exposure to cybersecurity?__  
No. However, experience with coding in a programming language will be  helpful.
