<p class="message">
We are currently accepting applications for 2023 Summer Program.
</p>

__Q. Could you tell me more?__   
Yes. We are a [group of people]({{ site.baseurl }}/mentors/) 
who wanted to provide you resources to build a skillset (and possibly a career) 
in cybersecurity. Our vision is a program where mentors listen to you about
your interests, ask you about your goals then design a path from where you 
are to where you want to get in cybersecurity. And if you are new to the whole
field, we will take you through an [introductory curriculum here]({{site.baseurl}}/outline).

For more details, checkout [our talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF10yA3GPJ0)
on [ThreatCon 2022](https://2022.threatcon.io).

__Q. Is it गाँजाबार? (...nervous laughter...)__   
It's गजबार. In some traditional Nepali houses, 
a horizontal wooden bar secures the door from the inside. 
One of its names is gajabaar.

__Q. Do I need prior exposure to cybersecurity?__  
No. You may find prior programming experience helpful. 
However, you will certainly need a computer and a stable internet connection. 
If you don't have one, we might still be able to work out a temporary solution for you.

__Q. When will the program run?__   
June, July, August, 2023. 
*This schedule is flexible to work around your more urgent commitments (like exams) with prior notice.*

Some of our mentees go on to stay with us and get involved
on other projects/platforms.

__Q. Do I need to pay to be in the program?__   
No. In the past, we have also covered costs on behalf of the participants, 
including subscriptions to [Pentesterlab](https://pentesterlab.com),
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), and [National Cyber League](https://nationalcyberleague.org).

__Q. How much time will I commit?__   
We anticipate 10-20 hrs per week.
Workload will be adjusted as per feedback from the participant group.

__Q. Is it remote or on-site?__  
It's remote until the pandemic is under control. You might be meeting
with some mentors in person for tea/coffee depending on their summer location.

__Q. Is there a catch?__   
No.

__Q. Where do I apply?__   
Application guidelines are available on [How to Apply]({{site.baseurl}}/apply) page.

We strongly ENCOURAGE that you attend one of the info sessions listed on the 
[same page]({{site.baseurl}}/apply).

__Q. When is the application deadline?__   
April 14, 2023

__Q. What happens when I submit my application?__   
Once the application comes in, expect all future communication 
to be over discord. For that reason, please make sure you have joined
our discord server (invite code: aY6PEUA) and that your discord handle
that you provide us in your application is correct. We will add you to
a channel in discord and schedule an interview.

Candidates who submit their applications earlier will be interviewed earlier.

__Q. In the meantime, how can I get in touch?__   
We are most responsive on our discord channel (invite code: aY6PEUA). 
It might take a day or two to get approved.

We usually respond within a few days. 
The response sometimes lands on spam folder.
