Dear Gajabaar 2021 candidate,
Good job for submitting that application. You are in for an intensive 8 weeks of learning and perhaps making a friend or two.
Some advice: start on your assignments early. It is going to take more than 10 hours every week. Speak up during the lectures/meetings!
All the best,
Gajabaar 2020 candidate

Dear applicant,
I know many of you are new to this field. 
Some are very enthusiastic but don’t know how to begin with. 
And some of you need an environment to test your skills, grow and compete. 
Me and my fellow colleagues were dealing with the same feelings that you might have.

Gajabaar was my first step in the cyber security learning process. 
It was challenging to keep up with the tasks and different vulnerability challenges. 
It started easy and every week it ramped up. After all, it was what I signed up for. 
Every week taught a lot. There were tons of challenges and resources. 
The mentors and the colleagues were very friendly and there was no communication gap. 
There were tons of write-ups to to do each week after cracking the problems and I never thought, 
just the mere act of expressing what you did would be so satisfying. 
It just fueled the enthusiasm for learning and practicing.

I know it lasted only 8 weeks, but boy, it was hectic and random. 
Every week there were new things to try on. 
There were research papers on some, and it was fascinating to find to what extent people are researching in this field. 
The video conference each week rejuvenated me to keep doing more. It was a journey and I will remember this for a long time. 
After all, it's all about the impact that this journey made in my life.

Also, an advice, don’t stall. It just piles up and that’s no fun. Enjoy every week as next week brings a fresh lot of stuff to keep you busy.

To
The Gajabaar

Respected Sir / Miss,
	
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for hosting Gajabaar 2020 and having me as a part of this journey. 
Past two months have been undoubtedly the most productive days of my 4 years at BE. 
I have so much respect to all the mentors and friends for where we have gone with this programme. 
I would just try to summarize my experience with the Gajabaar throughout and the positive impacts it made upon me.

It all started two months back, we were all locked up in our rooms for the COVID pandemic, so was I, 
just chilling watching movies and playing games. Let me be honest, the first two months of quarantine 
I did nothing just sometimes final year’s Major Project work. 
We had a google form on class group about this programme called gajabaar related to cyber security. 
I was very much interested in the field, was trying to get in but the vast scope 
and contents to cover all over the internet, it was very difficult for me to really get the initial start. 
I would just play random ctf’s sometime or spend most of time trying to learn a new js framework. 
I had a good background with python and linux (thought so). So I applied for it, interview went well and was accepted for the programme.

The programme was focused for all the people interested irrespective of their background. 
So first few assignments were related to basic linux and scripting. 
It was this time I realized what I thought of my skills was wrong. 
I would struggle with basic linux challenges and forget commands again and again. 
I realized that having used linux as first OS for few years I had scratched nothing but all those most common 10 commands only. 
The labs were really helpful and doing them gave me more expoure to the commands and short tricks and new concepts and how linux file systems work, 
all together it was fun. After that we had labs on sql injection and did some sql challenges, went on with natas and other online challenges. 
I also started doing rooms in Try Hack Me, its an awesome learning site for begineers, well guided and has many rooms to learn different concepts from. 
After some 2-3 weeks I was really addicted to it, so I quit facebook to focus, used to spend lots of time on socials, 
but started using Twitter, followed some well known personalities in this community and believe me twitter’s cyber community is so helpful. 
They are always posting about new contents and news. 
I also got an one month subscription from one of the guy on Try Hack Me for free ! 
Since then I have been trying to do atleast one room a day. 
I remember when I was at my first week I participated on a CTF called NahamCon, struggled at it, could only solve basic challenges. 
But coincidently we had a HacktivityCon2020 CTF at the final week, we participated as a team. 
I bagged 1960 points and a rank 120. 
I mean it wasn’t much but really showed what progress I had in this 8 weeks. 
This time I could solve atleast two from all the categories and had the idea of the exploit if not get the flag. 
My next goal is top 100 in the next CTF.

After all this, I think I have passed over that first initial step I needed which I was searching when I had none to guide. 
Now I atleast know the roadmap to follow. 
I am thankful to everyone who’s been part of this journey and would love to continue it for the following days too together.

Dear 2021 Applicants,

If you are reading this, feel blessed that you survived the devastating year, 2020. 
Gajabaar started in July 2020. 
It was the mid Lockdown season in Nepal and in other countries worldwide. 
As per I know, our mentors tried to utilize this leisure period in something productive and this is how Gajabaar was created.

I was very new to cyber security then. 
I had barely used Linux OS; 
I did not know what CTFs are; 
what a cyber security professional does. 
When I was interviewed, I told them these things so clearly. 
I told them I did not know the basics; 
I just knew a word cyber security and I was fascinated by that word. 
But of course I got selected; or else I would not be writing this.

Then it started. 
Throughout the journey, the mentors guided us as per our requirements and caliber. 
They knew what would be difficult for me and what would make my path easier. 
Often in many labs and CTFs, I would feel it difficult to understand a problem, its motive, process or anything else. 
They were always ready to guide me through any sort of situation, be it via code analysis, examples, blogs, write-ups, interaction through calls, etc. 
They never stopped until I was satisfied with the solution. 
I remember, once I wanted to calculate the length of a text (which was quite away from the track); 
there were other easy solutions for the actual problem. 
But because I was so focused to solve the problem on my own way, 
my mentor and I sat in a video call for around an hr until we found the solution and I understood the concept. 
This is how much passionate they are towards guiding us.

Our discussions was not limited to the mentors, I would talk to other participants, 
learn from them and guide them. I never felt missed out or any sort of demotivating energy from the Gajabaar team. 
They always encouraged me, made it easy for me to share my opinion or my issue. 
Gajabaar was so flexible that I rarely felt I would not be able to complete a session or my other activities would get disturbed if 
I devote to gajabaar. I always learned new things throughout the session. 
And I am really grateful to all my mentors, my fellow participants and this opportunity.

It is totally fine even if you have never used linux, 
or windows or do not know security terminologies 
or never interacted with security stuffs, just like me. 
I can assure, you would never regret joining Gajabaar team. 
It does not require any prequalifications and experiences.
Here, you will always be around positive energy and motivated people.

To whom it may concern

I am delighted to write this letter as my experience with gajabaar. 
If you are the one who is considering to get mentorship and take a step forward building your career. 
Gajabaar would be fantastic learning opportunities for you.

Gaajabar certainly will surpass your expectation. 
With weekely sessions about new topic and syallabus that keeps updating according to your progress and assignments,
they will make sure you are at the point when you are ready before introducing you to new topics and challenges.

The mentors are very helpful and always ready to give you time one to one whenever you are struck somewhere during the learning process.

The only tips I can give to future applicants to gajabaar is to ask question to your mentor (LIke a LOT) 
and practice because there is a difference between knowing how to ride a car and actually riding a car.

At last I want to thank Gajabaar whole team for providing me with such great opportunities and teaching me some awesome stuffs.

PS: The biggest achievement that i got from this programme is that it made my habit to practice and keep learning new things, 
which is the ultimate goal of every students.

Gajabaar program is one of the best programs that I have been to. 
I find myself lucky to be enrolled in this program. 
There are multiple aspects of Gajabaar that I feel really impressed about. 
It is one of the best programs for those who wish to learn about cybersecurity. 
Cybersecurity is a vast field, and I think that without problem guidance and continuous help, 
it is difficult to set in this field and even more challenging to continue. 
The seniors in the Gajabaar have helped us in this field. 
They had provided us with the curriculum for multiple weeks and provided us with guidance and help if needed. 
The seniors in the Gajabaar are cooperative, and they support us to the extent that we feel unreal.

The next best thing about Gajabaar is the feeling of the classroom. 
There are multiple other students from different colleges, which gives us a sense of the classroom. 
The discussion and questions asked by other students and the help of seniors in this aspect really motivates us to strive forward and work harder. 
Similarly, I feel that the program has really helped me improve myself in the case of cybersecurity rapidly. 
If I had been studying this topic on my own, 
I would have been derailed and demotivated time to time again but with the help of Gajabaar I didn't feel demotivated, 
I felt my own growth in learning and skills, I felt excitement while doing labs and submitting it and so on.

From my point of view, those who are learning the cybersecurity should apply for the Gajabaar as it certainly provides you more than what you asked for.
Actually as a gajabaar candiate, I feel so impressed, satisfied from the gajabar team and expectation went really nice. 
Team helped me through each and every trouble that I faced past 2 months. Weekly guiding strategic for us was really a impressive one.
So for 2021 candiate I would like to convey a message that enrolling in 
gajabaar will change your view what actually is a Cyber Security 
and the carrier in this field through the practical labs which will be like a real world type.
