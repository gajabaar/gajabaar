We, at gajabaar, are thinking of supporting one or two candidates with their [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/). If selected, we intend to provide the candidates with the necessary (partial/full) financial and academic support to go through the certification. This will come in the form of lab subscriptions and academic mentorship with people involved in the cybersecurity field. If interested, give the following questions some serious thought:

- Introduce yourself. [250 words max.]
    
    Some relevant information could be your 
    
    - current position â€” what you do for your day-to-day
    - home/current location
    - educational background
    - hobbies
    - things you read/follow/subscribe to

- Write a letter to the decision committee explaining why you would be a good fit for this fellowship and why this fellowship would be a good fit for you. [250-500 words]
    - In your answer, also try to include the obstacles that are currently preventing you from going for OSCP and your motivation to overcome them.
    - Optionally, you can expand the piece to include your relationship with cybersecurity.

- Assuming you have no non-academic concerns (ex. financial, logistics, accommodation, hardware, etc.), map out a plan for yourself to get OSCP. Make sure to give us a sense of your current skill level, the skills you would want/need to gain and how you would gain them. Try containing the timeline to a year at most.

Email your questions/concerns/application-package to `hello@gajabaar.io`. In absence of a response, check your spam then email us a reminder. The deadline is December 15th. Applications sent in sooner will hear back from us sooner.

*FAQ:* 

- Are there OSCP holders in the core gajabaar team? No. But we can connect you to some. Within the team, we have people who work on individual topics (Binary Exploitation/Web Exploitation,...) even though the skill set isn't tied together as certifications.

- How many people are you taking? We don't know yet. Could be 0. Could be 2.

- Can full-time job-holders apply? Yes. Be sure to make a strong case on your letter to the committee explaining how you will find the time for the practice though. It's okay to propose a more relaxed schedule. Think what works best for you.

- Is this a giveaway? Nope. This is a collaboration. We would like to work with you on making your plans easier. Plan to take lead on your roadmap but expect changes as the mentors see fit.

- Do I start with OSCP labs from Day 1? Depends on your current skill level. If you are just starting, we might direct you to more accessible resources like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, Proving Grounds, VulnHub before we are convinced that you can get on the OSCP labs. Even if you are a more seasoned practitioner, we might still suggest you cover the foundational resources available out there (ex. [tjnull's list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0)) before jumping into OSCP labs. Consider including this as part of your roadmap.
